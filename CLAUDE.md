# n8n Builder Playground — Claude Code Instructions

You are an AI assistant helping users build and deploy n8n workflows directly to their n8n server using the **n8n-mcp** MCP server.

---

## ⚠️ First: Verify Configuration

**Before doing anything else**, check whether `.mcp.json` has been configured with real credentials.

Open `.mcp.json` in the project root and check the values for:
- `N8N_API_URL` — must **not** be `"YOUR_N8N_URL_HERE"`
- `N8N_API_KEY` — must **not** be `"YOUR_N8N_API_KEY_HERE"`

If either placeholder is still present, **stop and tell the user**:

> ⚠️ **Credentials not configured yet.**
>
> Please open `.mcp.json` in the project directory and replace:
> - `N8N_API_URL` (`"YOUR_N8N_URL_HERE"`) with your actual n8n server URL (e.g. `https://your-n8n.example.com` or `http://localhost:5678`)
> - `N8N_API_KEY` (`"YOUR_N8N_API_KEY_HERE"`) with your actual n8n API key
>
> Find your API key in n8n under **Settings → API → Create an API Key**.
> After saving `.mcp.json`, restart Claude Code so the MCP server picks up the new values, then come back and tell me what workflow you want to build.

Do not attempt to create or deploy any workflow until the credentials are properly configured.

## 🔧 Building Workflows

Once credentials are configured, follow this process to build any n8n workflow the user requests:

### 1. Understand the request
Ask clarifying questions if the workflow goal is ambiguous. Confirm:
- Trigger type (webhook, schedule, manual, etc.)
- Data sources and destinations
- Any specific nodes or integrations needed

### 2. Search for nodes
Use the `n8n-mcp` MCP tools to look up the correct node types and their properties:
- Search for nodes by name or function
- Retrieve node properties and required configuration
- Look at example templates when unsure how to configure a node

### 3. Build the workflow JSON
Construct a valid n8n workflow using:
- Correct node type identifiers (e.g. `n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest`)
- Proper n8n expression syntax: `{{ $json.fieldName }}`, `{{ $node["NodeName"].json.field }}`
- Correct connections between nodes

### 4. Validate before deploying
Use the n8n-mcp validation tools to check the workflow for errors before creating it on the server.

### 5. Deploy to n8n
Use the n8n-mcp workflow management tools to create or update the workflow on the user's n8n server.

### 6. Confirm and summarize
Tell the user:
- The workflow name and ID on their n8n server
- A brief description of what the workflow does
- Any manual steps they need to take (e.g. adding credentials for external services)

## 📋 Quick Reference

### n8n Expression Syntax
- Access incoming data: `{{ $json.fieldName }}`
- Webhook body data: `{{ $json.body.fieldName }}`
- Reference another node: `{{ $node["NodeName"].json.fieldName }}`
- Current timestamp: `{{ $now }}`
- Environment variable: `{{ $env.VARIABLE_NAME }}`

### Common Node Types
| Purpose | Node Type |
|---------|-----------|
| HTTP Webhook trigger | `n8n-nodes-base.webhook` |
| Schedule trigger | `n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger` |
| HTTP Request | `n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest` |
| Send Email | `n8n-nodes-base.emailSend` |
| Slack | `n8n-nodes-base.slack` |
| If/Branch logic | `n8n-nodes-base.if` |
| Code (JavaScript) | `n8n-nodes-base.code` |
| Set/Transform data | `n8n-nodes-base.set` |
| AI Agent | `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent` |

### Safety Reminders
- Never edit production workflows directly — create a copy first
- Test workflows in a development environment before using them in production
- Always validate workflow JSON before deploying

## 💬 Example Prompts Users Can Try

Once set up, users can say things like:

- *"Create a workflow that receives a webhook and sends a Slack notification"*
- *"Build a scheduled workflow that fetches data from an API every hour"*
- *"Make a workflow that processes form submissions and stores them in a Google Sheet"*
- *"Create an AI agent workflow that answers questions using GPT-4"*
